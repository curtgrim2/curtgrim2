<div class = "describe"> In building this website, the main thing that I kept in mind was simplicity.
  Users from all ages with a basic understanding of English should be able to navigate through this website with plenty of ease.<br>
Sometimes less is more and I am of the mindset that an exhaustion of too many resources is unnecessary and in some cases too much for people to
handle. I took the minamalist approach with planning and constructing this website so that I wouldn't bombard anyone who comes
across any page.

  The theme that the site is based around is the unknown realms of outer space. I thought this was appropriate with this being seen as
  my own personal space where I can express myself and showcase my abilities.

<h>Inspirations</h>
<ul>
<li><h2> nick.com </h2> - The templates that Nickelodeon displayed the past is a huge reason why I web develop. The
intricacies that users can explore combined with the visuals shown was nothing short of awe-inspiring for me.  </li>
<li><h2> kanyewest.com </h2> - Remove the space theme, and at it's bare bones my site is structed similarly to Mr.West's. With a breathy feel, ton's
  of free space, and only provided essential information, I would not be surprised if the developers and I shared the same mindsets when
  building both sites.</li>
<li> <h2> wikipedia.org </h2>- In the midst of my website creation, I often referenced this site specifically to come up with clues on how to
  display information.  </li>
<li><h2> crunchyroll.com </h2> - The opposition of the minamalist approach I've mentioned previously, but in regards to how they juggle that information
is highly impressive and something that I keep in mind when building websites. There's always a way to make the pieces fit!  </li>
<li> <h2> campfloggnaw.com </h2> - My idea for having the moving mist in my background is directly attributed to the moving clouds on this site!   </li>
